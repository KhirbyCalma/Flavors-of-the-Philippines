        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Bistek, often referred to simply as "Bistek," is a classic Filipino dish that showcases tender slices of beef marinated in a soy sauce and calamansi (or lemon) mixture, then pan-fried and simmered with onions. 
            The dish is known for its savory, tangy, and slightly sweet flavor profile, which perfectly complements the succulent beef. 
            Bistek is typically served with steamed white rice, making it a comforting and satisfying meal that is both easy to prepare and deeply flavorful.

            The key to a great Bistek is in the marination process, which infuses the beef with the rich, umami flavors of soy sauce and the bright acidity of calamansi. 
            After marinating, the beef is quickly pan-fried to lock in the juices and develop a nice sear. 
            Sliced onions are then caramelized in the same pan, adding a touch of sweetness to the dish. 
            The beef and onions are combined and simmered in the marinade until the flavors meld together, creating a deliciously balanced sauce. 
            Bistek is often garnished with additional caramelized onions and served with a side of vegetables, making it a well-rounded and delectable dish that is a staple in Filipino cuisine.
