        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lumpia, often referred to as Filipino spring rolls, is a beloved dish that exemplifies the rich culinary heritage of the Philippines. 
            These delightful rolls are typically made by filling thin, delicate wrappers with a mixture of savory ingredients.
            The most common filling includes ground pork or beef, finely chopped vegetables like carrots, onions, and green beans, and sometimes shrimp or other seafood.
            This filling is seasoned with garlic, salt, pepper, and soy sauce to enhance its flavors. 
            Once the mixture is prepared, it is carefully wrapped in the lumpia wrappers, rolled tightly, and then fried until golden brown and crispy. 
            The result is a perfect combination of a crunchy exterior and a savory, flavorful interior.

            Lumpia is often served as an appetizer or snack and is a staple at Filipino gatherings and celebrations. 
            It is typically accompanied by a dipping sauce, with sweet chili sauce being a popular choice. 
            The dish is cherished for its versatility, as it can be adapted to include a variety of fillings, including vegetarian options. 
            Beyond its taste, lumpia holds a special place in Filipino culture, symbolizing hospitality and the joy of sharing food with loved ones. 
            Whether enjoyed hot and fresh from the fryer or at room temperature, lumpia remains a crowd-pleaser that embodies the warmth and richness of Filipino cuisine.
